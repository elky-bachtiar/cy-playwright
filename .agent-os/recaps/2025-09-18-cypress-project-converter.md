# Cypress Project Converter - Recap Document

**Date:** 2025-09-18
**Spec:** `.agent-os/specs/2025-09-18-cypress-project-converter/`

## Project Overview

The Cypress Project Converter is a CLI tool that converts complete Cypress projects to Playwright projects by parsing test files, configuration files, and custom commands, then generating equivalent Playwright project structure and code. This tool automates the full migration process from Cypress to Playwright framework, preserving test coverage while translating syntax and configurations to maintain functionality during framework transition.

### Key Implementation Details - Task 2

#### AST Parsing Engine Architecture
- **TypeScript Compiler API Integration:** Full utilization of TypeScript's AST parsing capabilities for robust code analysis
- **File Pattern Detection:** Comprehensive regex patterns for detecting Cypress test files and custom command files
- **Syntax Tree Traversal:** Recursive node visiting with proper error handling for malformed code
- **Command Chain Analysis:** Advanced parsing of chained Cypress commands (e.g., `cy.get().click().should()`)

#### Core AST Parser Features
- **Multi-format Support:** Handles .js, .ts, .jsx, .tsx file extensions with appropriate TypeScript parsing
- **Describe/Test Block Parsing:** Extracts nested describe blocks and it/test blocks with proper hierarchy
- **Import Statement Extraction:** Parses ES6 import statements for dependency analysis
- **Custom Command Recognition:** Detects `Cypress.Commands.add()` and `Cypress.Commands.overwrite()` patterns
- **Line Number Tracking:** Maintains source location information for debugging and error reporting

#### Project Structure - Task 2
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ast-parser.ts    # Main AST parsing engine (11,424 bytes)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.ts         # Extended type definitions for AST structures
tests/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ast-parser.test.ts # Comprehensive AST parser test suite (6,892 bytes)
```

#### Test Coverage Breakdown
- **File Detection Tests (3 tests):** JavaScript/TypeScript test file patterns, custom command file detection
- **AST Parsing Tests (5 tests):** Basic test parsing, command extraction, nested describes, imports, syntax errors

- TypeScript AST parsing for all Cypress file types (.cy.js/.ts, .spec.js/.ts, .test.js/.ts)
- Cypress command extraction with argument parsing and chained call detection
- Custom command detection and parsing from support files
- Comprehensive test coverage ensuring code reliability

**Next Steps:** Begin implementation of Task 3 (Command Mapping System) to convert extracted Cypress commands to equivalent Playwright syntax.
