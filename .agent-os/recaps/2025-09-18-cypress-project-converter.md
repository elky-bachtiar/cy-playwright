# Cypress Project Converter - Recap Document

**Date:** 2025-09-18
**Spec:** `.agent-os/specs/2025-09-18-cypress-project-converter/`

## Project Overview

The Cypress Project Converter is a CLI tool that converts complete Cypress projects to Playwright projects by parsing test files, configuration files, and custom commands, then generating equivalent Playwright project structure and code. This tool automates the full migration process from Cypress to Playwright framework, preserving test coverage while translating syntax and configurations to maintain functionality during framework transition.
