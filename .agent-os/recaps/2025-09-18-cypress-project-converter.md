# Cypress Project Converter - Recap Document

**Date:** 2025-09-18
**Spec:** `.agent-os/specs/2025-09-18-cypress-project-converter/`

## Project Overview

The Cypress Project Converter is a CLI tool that converts complete Cypress projects to Playwright projects by parsing test files, configuration files, and custom commands, then generating equivalent Playwright project structure and code. This tool automates the full migration process from Cypress to Playwright framework, preserving test coverage while translating syntax and configurations to maintain functionality during framework transition.

## Completed Features

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Project Foundation and CLI Interface (COMPLETED)

All subtasks have been successfully implemented and verified:

- **‚úÖ 1.1 CLI Tests:** Comprehensive test suite with 10 passing tests covering argument parsing, project validation, and directory operations
- **‚úÖ 1.2 TypeScript Setup:** Full TypeScript project configuration with proper build pipeline and type definitions
- **‚úÖ 1.3 Dependencies:** All required dependencies installed and configured:
  - `commander` for CLI interface
  - `fs-extra` for enhanced file operations
  - `@typescript-eslint/typescript-estree` for AST parsing
  - `glob` for file pattern matching
  - Full development toolchain (Jest, ESLint, TypeScript)
- **‚úÖ 1.4 CLI Entry Point:** Complete CLI structure with `cy2pw convert` command and proper argument handling
- **‚úÖ 1.5 Project Validation:** Robust Cypress project detection and validation system
- **‚úÖ 1.6 Test Verification:** All tests passing (10/10) with comprehensive coverage

### Key Implementation Details

#### CLI Interface
- **Command:** `cy2pw convert -s <source> -o <output>`
- **Options:**
  - `--preserve-structure`: Maintain original directory layout
  - `--generate-page-objects`: Convert custom commands to page objects (default: true)
  - `--verbose`: Enable detailed logging
- **Validation:** Source directory existence, Cypress project detection, output directory creation

#### Project Structure
```

```

#### Technical Foundation
- **Language:** TypeScript with strict configuration
- **Package Manager:** npm with locked dependencies
- **Testing:** Jest with 100% test pass rate
- **Build System:** TypeScript compiler with dist/ output
- **CLI Binary:** `cy2pw` command available in package.json bin

## Pending Features

### üîÑ Task 2: AST Parsing Engine (NOT STARTED)
- TypeScript AST parsing for Cypress files
- File detection for .spec.js, .spec.ts, .cy.js, .cy.ts patterns
- Cypress command extraction from syntax trees
- Custom command detection and parsing

### üîÑ Task 3: Command Mapping System (NOT STARTED)
- Core command mapping (cy.get ‚Üí page.locator, cy.click ‚Üí locator.click)
- Assertion conversion (should ‚Üí expect)
- Async/await pattern injection
- Custom command to page object conversion

### üîÑ Task 4: Configuration Migration (NOT STARTED)
- cypress.config.js parsing and extraction
- Playwright configuration mapping
- playwright.config.js generation
- Environment variables handling

### üîÑ Task 5: Project Generation (NOT STARTED)
- Playwright directory structure creation
- Converted test file generation
- Page object file creation from custom commands
- File writing with error handling and validation
- Conversion summary and reporting

## Technical Architecture

### Current Implementation Status
- **CLI Framework:** Fully implemented with Commander.js
- **File System Operations:** Complete with fs-extra
- **Project Validation:** Robust Cypress project detection
- **Type Safety:** Comprehensive TypeScript definitions
- **Test Coverage:** All functionality tested with Jest

### Next Phase Requirements
- **AST Processing:** TypeScript Compiler API integration for code parsing
- **Code Transformation:** Syntax tree manipulation for command conversion
- **Template Generation:** Playwright project structure and file templates
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive conversion error management

## Context from Spec

### Primary User Stories
1. **Complete Project Migration:** Convert entire Cypress test suites to Playwright with preserved functionality
2. **Framework Transition:** Maintain test coverage and logic during migration process

### Technical Requirements
- Parse all Cypress file types (.spec.js, .spec.ts, .cy.js, .cy.ts)
- Convert cypress.config.js to playwright.config.js
- Transform custom commands into page object methods
- Generate complete Playwright project structure
- Maintain test logic and assertions during conversion

### Success Metrics
- ‚úÖ Functional CLI tool (ACHIEVED)
- ‚è≥ Generated Playwright files with equivalent logic (PENDING)
- ‚è≥ Configuration migration with proper settings (PENDING)

## Current Status Summary

**Phase 1 Complete:** The project foundation is solid with a fully functional CLI interface, comprehensive test suite, and proper TypeScript configuration. All infrastructure is in place for the core conversion functionality.

**Next Steps:** Begin implementation of Task 2 (AST Parsing Engine) to enable actual code analysis and transformation capabilities.

**Test Status:** 10/10 tests passing, indicating stable foundation ready for feature development.
