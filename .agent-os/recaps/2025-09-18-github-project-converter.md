# 2025-09-18 Recap: GitHub Project Converter - Task 1 Implementation

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-18-github-project-converter/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully completed Task 1: Repository Management and Project Detection for the GitHub Project Converter. This foundational implementation provides robust GitHub repository handling and intelligent Cypress project detection capabilities. Key achievements include:

- **GitHub Repository Service**: Complete repository cloning, validation, and branch management using simple-git
- **Cypress Project Detector**: Advanced analysis of project structure, dependencies, and configurations
- **Advanced Feature Detection**: Comprehensive scanning for custom commands, selectors, CI/CD configurations, and mobile/desktop variants
- **Integration Testing**: Full test coverage with 119+ passing tests and repository integration validation
- **TypeScript Infrastructure**: Enhanced type safety and compilation compatibility across all components

The implementation establishes the core foundation for the GitHub Project Converter, enabling reliable repository analysis and setting the groundwork for the conversion pipeline and API services.

## Context

A comprehensive web-based tool that converts GitHub-hosted Cypress projects to Playwright by cloning repositories, analyzing advanced patterns, and providing downloadable converted projects with full validation.

Key project goals:
- Clone and convert any public GitHub Cypress repository via URL input
- Handle advanced patterns like centralized selectors, custom commands, and dynamic viewports
- Generate downloadable zip files with fully functional Playwright projects
- Provide REST API for programmatic access and CI/CD integration
- Validate converted projects across desktop and mobile viewports
- Real-time progress tracking and comprehensive error handling
