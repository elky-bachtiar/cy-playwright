# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Cypress Project Converter
> Created: 2025-09-18

## Overview

Create a CLI tool that converts complete Cypress projects to Playwright projects by parsing test files, configuration files, and custom commands, then generating equivalent Playwright project structure and code. This tool will automate the full migration process from Cypress to Playwright framework.

## User Stories

### Complete Project Migration

As a development team lead, I want to convert our entire Cypress test suite to Playwright, so that we can leverage Playwright's performance and cross-browser capabilities without manually rewriting hundreds of test files.

The tool will scan the Cypress project directory, identify all test files (*.spec.js, *.spec.ts, *.cy.js, *.cy.ts), configuration files (cypress.config.js), support files, and custom commands. It will then generate a complete Playwright project with converted test files, playwright.config.js, and equivalent page object models for custom commands.

### Framework Transition

As a QA engineer, I want to migrate from Cypress to Playwright while preserving test coverage and functionality, so that our existing test investment is not lost during the framework transition.

The converter will maintain test structure, assertions, and test logic while translating Cypress syntax to Playwright equivalents. Custom commands will be converted to reusable page object methods, and configuration settings will be mapped to Playwright project configuration.

## Spec Scope

1. **Cypress Test File Parsing** - Parse and analyze all Cypress test files (.spec.js, .spec.ts, .cy.js, .cy.ts) to extract test structure and commands
2. **Configuration Migration** - Convert cypress.config.js settings to playwright.config.js with equivalent configurations
3. **Custom Command Conversion** - Transform Cypress custom commands into Playwright page object methods
4. **Support File Migration** - Convert Cypress support files to Playwright global setup and teardown
5. **Project Structure Generation** - Create complete Playwright project directory structure with converted files

## Out of Scope

- Visual regression testing migration
- Cypress Studio recordings
- Plugin ecosystem migration beyond core functionality
- Real-time conversion (batch processing only)

## Expected Deliverable

1. A functional CLI tool that converts a Cypress project directory to a complete Playwright project
2. Generated Playwright test files that maintain original test logic and coverage
3. Playwright configuration file with equivalent settings from Cypress configuration
