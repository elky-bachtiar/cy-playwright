# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-18-cypress-project-converter/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- **AST Parsing Engine**: Use TypeScript Compiler API to parse Cypress test files and extract syntax trees for analysis
- **File System Operations**: Implement recursive directory scanning to identify all Cypress project files (.spec.js, .spec.ts, .cy.js, .cy.ts, cypress.config.js)
- **Command Mapping System**: Create mapping tables from Cypress commands (cy.get, cy.click, cy.should) to Playwright equivalents (page.locator, locator.click, expect)
- **Configuration Converter**: Parse cypress.config.js and generate playwright.config.js with equivalent browser, viewport, and timeout settings
- **Custom Command Parser**: Extract Cypress.Commands.add() definitions and convert to Playwright page object methods
- **Code Generation Engine**: Generate syntactically correct TypeScript/JavaScript Playwright test files with proper imports and async/await patterns
- **CLI Interface**: Provide command-line interface with options for source directory, output directory, and conversion preferences
- **Project Structure Generator**: Create standard Playwright directory structure (tests/, test-results/, playwright-report/)

## External Dependencies

- **@typescript-eslint/typescript-estree** - TypeScript AST parsing for accurate syntax analysis
- **Justification:** Required for parsing both JavaScript and TypeScript Cypress files with proper type information
- **commander** - CLI argument parsing and command structure
- **Justification:** Provides robust command-line interface with help documentation and argument validation
- **fs-extra** - Enhanced file system operations for directory manipulation
- **Justification:** Needed for recursive directory operations and safe file writing with proper error handling
