# Spec Tasks

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Enhance PageObjectAnalyzer for Edge Case Detection
  - [x] 1.1 Write tests for inheritance pattern detection (abstract classes, extends chains, mixins)
  - [x] 1.2 Implement AST analysis for inheritance keywords and class hierarchies
  - [x] 1.3 Add dynamic method detection in constructor bodies and property assignments
  - [x] 1.4 Implement composition pattern recognition for nested page object references
  - [x] 1.5 Add circular reference detection using dependency graph analysis
  - [x] 1.6 Implement generic type parameter extraction and static method identification
  - [x] 1.7 Add getter/setter pattern recognition for ES6 property syntax
  - [x] 1.8 Verify all edge case detection tests pass

- [ ] 2. Enhance PageObjectTransformer for Edge Case Conversion
  - [ ] 2.1 Write tests for inheritance flattening to composition patterns
