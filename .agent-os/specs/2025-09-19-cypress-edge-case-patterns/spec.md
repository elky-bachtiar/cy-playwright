> Spec: Cypress Edge Case Page Object Pattern Testing
> Created: 2025-09-19

## Overview

Enhance the cy-playwright conversion tool to handle unusual but valid Cypress page object patterns that real users create, ensuring robust conversion of edge cases like inheritance chains, dynamic method generation, and complex composition patterns. This feature will improve conversion success rates by handling the "weird but valid" patterns that currently cause conversion failures in real-world projects.

## User Stories

### Edge Case Pattern Detection

As a developer migrating from Cypress to Playwright, I want the conversion tool to handle my unusual page object patterns, so that I don't have to manually rewrite complex inheritance hierarchies and dynamic method generation.

The conversion tool should detect and properly convert inheritance chains where base classes define abstract methods, child classes implement specific behaviors, and multiple levels of inheritance exist. It should also handle cases where page objects dynamically generate methods in constructors or use advanced TypeScript features like generics and mixins.

### Composition and Circular Reference Handling

As a test automation engineer, I want the conversion tool to handle my nested page object compositions and circular references, so that my existing page object architecture doesn't break during migration.

The tool should detect when page objects reference other page objects as properties, handle circular navigation patterns between pages, and convert complex composition chains while preserving the original navigation flow and method chaining capabilities.

### Dynamic Method Pattern Conversion

As a senior developer, I want my dynamically generated page object methods to be converted to static Playwright equivalents, so that I maintain the same testing interface after migration.

The conversion should analyze constructor logic that dynamically adds methods to page object instances, extract the method generation patterns, and create equivalent static methods in the converted Playwright page objects while preserving type safety and parameter signatures.

## Spec Scope

1. **Inheritance Pattern Conversion** - Handle abstract base classes, multiple inheritance levels, and mixin patterns
2. **Dynamic Method Detection** - Identify and convert constructor-based method generation and property assignment
3. **Composition Analysis** - Process nested page object references and complex object hierarchies
4. **Circular Reference Resolution** - Detect and break circular dependencies while preserving navigation flow
5. **Advanced TypeScript Support** - Convert generic page objects, static methods, and getter/setter patterns

## Out of Scope

- Converting invalid JavaScript/TypeScript syntax that wouldn't compile
- Handling page objects that use non-standard Cypress plugins or extensions
- Converting page objects that rely on browser-specific APIs not supported by Playwright
- Migration of page objects using deprecated Cypress commands

## Expected Deliverable

1. The PageObjectAnalyzer can detect and categorize all unusual but valid page object patterns without conversion failures
2. The conversion tool generates functionally equivalent Playwright page objects for inheritance chains, dynamic methods, and composition patterns
3. All converted edge case patterns pass TypeScript compilation and maintain semantic equivalence to original Cypress functionality
