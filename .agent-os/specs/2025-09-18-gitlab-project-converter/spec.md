# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: GitLab Project Converter
> Created: 2025-09-18

## Overview

Extend the existing GitHub Project Converter to support GitLab-hosted Cypress projects, enabling users to convert GitLab repositories using the same automated conversion pipeline. This feature will provide unified repository support for both GitHub and GitLab platforms, expanding the tool's accessibility to teams using GitLab for version control.

## User Stories

### GitLab Repository Conversion

As a developer using GitLab for version control, I want to convert my Cypress test projects to Playwright using the same streamlined process available for GitHub repositories, so that I can modernize my testing framework regardless of my chosen Git platform.

The user will input a GitLab repository URL (e.g., https://gitlab.com/username/cypress-project), and the system will clone, analyze, convert, and package the project into a downloadable Playwright implementation, maintaining all advanced patterns and configurations found in the original Cypress setup.

### Unified Platform Support

As a team lead managing projects across multiple Git platforms, I want a single tool that can convert Cypress projects from both GitHub and GitLab repositories, so that I can standardize our testing approach without platform-specific migration tools.

The converter will automatically detect whether a provided URL is from GitHub or GitLab and route the request to the appropriate repository service while maintaining a consistent user interface and conversion experience.

### Private Repository Access

As a developer with private GitLab repositories, I want to authenticate with GitLab to convert private Cypress projects to Playwright, so that I can migrate proprietary codebases securely.

The system will support GitLab personal access tokens for private repository access, providing the same security model as the existing GitHub integration.

## Spec Scope

1. **GitLab Repository Service** - Implement GitLab API integration for repository cloning, branch management, and project analysis using GitLab's REST API
2. **URL Detection Logic** - Create intelligent URL parsing to automatically detect and route GitHub vs GitLab repositories to appropriate services
3. **GitLab Authentication** - Support GitLab personal access tokens for private repository access with secure token management
4. **Unified API Endpoints** - Extend existing REST API to accept both GitHub and GitLab URLs through the same conversion interface
5. **GitLab-specific Features** - Handle GitLab-specific repository structures, CI/CD configurations (.gitlab-ci.yml), and merge request templates

## Out of Scope

- Self-hosted GitLab instance support (GitLab.com only initially)
- GitLab Groups or organization-level batch conversions
- GitLab-specific advanced features like GitLab CI variables or registry integration
- Migration of GitLab Issues or merge requests metadata

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can successfully input GitLab repository URLs and receive converted Playwright projects with identical functionality to GitHub conversions
2. The system automatically detects repository platform and handles GitLab authentication when required for private repositories
3. All existing GitHub Project Converter features (advanced pattern detection, mobile/desktop variants, comprehensive validation) work seamlessly with GitLab repositories
