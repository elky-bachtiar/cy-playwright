> Spec: GitHub Project Converter
> Created: 2025-09-18
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Build a comprehensive GitHub project converter that can clone Cypress projects from GitHub repositories, analyze their structure and patterns, convert them to Playwright using our existing AST engine, and provide downloadable converted projects. The system will specifically target repositories like helenanull/cypress-example and handle advanced Cypress patterns including centralized selectors, .cmd.js files, dynamic viewports, and complex test configurations.

## User Stories

**As a developer**, I want to convert any public GitHub Cypress project to Playwright by simply providing the repository URL, so that I can quickly migrate existing test suites without manual effort.

**As a QA engineer**, I want the converter to handle advanced Cypress patterns like centralized selectors and custom commands, so that complex test architectures are properly migrated.

**As a team lead**, I want to download the fully converted project as a zip file, so that I can distribute it to my team for immediate use.

**As a developer**, I want the converter to validate both desktop and mobile test variants, so that I can ensure cross-platform compatibility is maintained after conversion.

**As an API consumer**, I want programmatic access to the conversion process, so that I can integrate this functionality into CI/CD pipelines and automation tools.

## Spec Scope

### Core Features
- **GitHub Repository Integration**: Clone and analyze public GitHub repositories containing Cypress projects
- **Advanced Pattern Recognition**: Detect and convert complex Cypress patterns including:
  - Centralized selector files (selectors.js, elements.js)
  - Custom command files (.cmd.js patterns)
  - Dynamic viewport configurations
  - Page Object Model implementations
  - Custom assertion libraries
- **AST-Powered Conversion**: Leverage existing AST parsing engine to convert complex code structures
- **CI/CD Configuration Migration**: Convert GitHub Actions, CircleCI, and AppVeyor configurations to Playwright equivalents
- **Docker Integration**: Handle Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml configurations for containerized testing
- **Script Migration**: Convert package.json scripts and custom build/test scripts
- **Comprehensive API Coverage**: Support all Cypress commands and patterns found in kitchen sink repositories
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Handle common Cypress plugins and suggest Playwright alternatives
- **Project Packaging**: Generate downloadable zip files containing fully converted Playwright projects
- **Validation Engine**: Run converted tests against both desktop and mobile viewports
- **REST API**: Provide programmatic access to all conversion functionality
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates during conversion process

### Target Repository Analysis
**Primary Target: helenanull/cypress-example**
- Multiple test suites with different configurations
- Centralized selector management (cypress/selectors/)
- Custom command definitions (.cmd.js files)
- Cross-browser test configurations
- Dynamic viewport and device testing

**Secondary Target: cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink**
- Comprehensive Cypress API usage patterns
- Multiple CI/CD configurations (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, AppVeyor)
- Docker integration and containerized testing
- Advanced plugin ecosystem usage
- Educational test patterns with extensive commenting
- Complex browser and environment configurations
- Package.json script orchestration
- Mobile and desktop viewport testing
- Complex assertion patterns
- Fixture file management

## Out of Scope

- Private repository access (requires authentication complexity)
- Conversion of non-JavaScript Cypress projects (TypeScript support in future iterations)
- Real-time collaboration features
- Version control integration beyond initial cloning
- Custom CI/CD pipeline generation
- Support for Cypress Studio recordings

## Expected Deliverable

A complete web-based GitHub project converter with the following components:

### Web Interface
- Repository URL input with validation
- Real-time conversion progress display
- Download management for converted projects
- Conversion history and results dashboard

### API Endpoints
- Repository analysis and validation
- Conversion job management
- Download link generation
- Status monitoring and reporting

### Conversion Engine
- Enhanced AST parser supporting GitHub project structures
- Pattern recognition for advanced Cypress features
- Intelligent file organization and restructuring
- Comprehensive validation and testing

### Output Quality
- Fully functional Playwright projects
- Maintained test coverage and functionality
- Proper configuration migration
- Documentation generation for converted projects
