# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Conversion Quality Improvements
> Created: 2025-09-19

## Overview

Improve the Cypress-to-Playwright conversion CLI to handle complex real-world test scenarios by fixing critical conversion failures identified in the DLA project analysis. This enhancement will increase conversion success rate from ~15% to >85% for production codebases with page objects, mocking, and complex test patterns.

## User Stories

### Developer Using Converter on Complex Projects

As a developer with an existing Cypress test suite containing page objects and API mocking, I want to convert my tests to Playwright with minimal manual intervention, so that I can migrate to Playwright without rewriting my entire test infrastructure.

The developer has a Cypress project with:
- Page object models using cy.get(), cy.visit(), cy.type(), cy.click()
- API interception with cy.intercept() and cy.wait().then()
- Custom commands and complex assertion patterns
- WireMock or other mocking integrations
- Mixed projects with existing Playwright tests

Currently, the conversion produces non-functional tests requiring extensive manual fixes.

### QA Engineer Validating Conversion

As a QA engineer, I want converted Playwright tests to maintain the same functionality as original Cypress tests, so that I can trust the conversion process and avoid regression in test coverage.

The QA engineer needs:
- Preserved test logic and assertions
- Working page object patterns
- Functional API mocking
- No syntax errors in converted files
- Consistent test behavior between Cypress and Playwright versions

## Spec Scope

1. **Import Deduplication** - Fix duplicate import statements that cause syntax errors
2. **Page Object Conversion** - Convert Cypress page object classes to functional Playwright equivalents
3. **Test Logic Preservation** - Maintain complex test patterns including cy.then(), cy.wait(), and chained assertions
4. **Mock Integration** - Properly convert cy.intercept() to page.route() with request handling
5. **Mixed Project Support** - Handle projects with existing Playwright tests without conflicts

## Out of Scope

- Complete rewrite of the conversion engine architecture
- Support for custom Cypress plugins or third-party integrations beyond standard patterns
- Performance optimization of converted tests
- Advanced Playwright features not equivalent to Cypress patterns

## Expected Deliverable

1. Conversion CLI that produces syntactically valid and functionally equivalent Playwright tests from complex Cypress projects
2. Page object conversion that maintains class structure and method functionality
3. Test execution success rate >85% for converted tests without manual intervention
