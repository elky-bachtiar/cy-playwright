Improve the Cypress-to-Playwright conversion CLI to handle complex real-world test scenarios including page objects, API mocking, and advanced test patterns. Fix critical conversion failures that currently result in non-functional tests, increasing conversion success rate from ~15% to >85% for production codebases with minimal manual intervention required.
