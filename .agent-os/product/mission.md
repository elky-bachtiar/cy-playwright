# Product Mission

## Pitch

Cy-Playwright is a migration tool that helps development teams switch from Cypress to Playwright by providing automated test conversion, configuration migration, and validation capabilities.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Development Teams**: Teams currently using Cypress who want to migrate to Playwright for better performance and features
- **QA Engineers**: Quality assurance professionals managing test automation frameworks and seeking modern testing solutions

### User Personas

**Lead QA Engineer** (30-45 years old)
- **Role:** Senior QA Engineer or Test Automation Lead
- **Context:** Managing test suites for web applications with growing complexity and cross-browser requirements
- **Pain Points:** Manual migration effort, risk of test coverage loss, time-consuming syntax conversion
- **Goals:** Seamless framework migration, maintaining test reliability, reducing migration timeline

**Frontend Developer** (25-40 years old)
- **Role:** Frontend Developer or Full-stack Developer
- **Context:** Working on modern web applications requiring robust end-to-end testing
- **Pain Points:** Learning new testing syntax, converting existing test infrastructure, ensuring test compatibility
- **Goals:** Quick framework adoption, minimal disruption to development workflow, improved testing capabilities

## The Problem

### Manual Migration Complexity

Converting Cypress tests to Playwright manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Teams spend weeks rewriting test suites, often missing edge cases and losing test coverage during the transition.

**Our Solution:** Automated syntax conversion that handles 90% of common test patterns, reducing migration time from weeks to days.

### Configuration Inconsistencies

Migrating test configurations and project settings between frameworks requires deep knowledge of both systems. Misconfigurations lead to unreliable tests and deployment issues.

**Our Solution:** Intelligent configuration migration that maps Cypress settings to equivalent Playwright configurations with validation.

### Test Validation Gaps

Without proper validation, teams cannot verify that converted tests maintain the same behavior and coverage as original Cypress tests.

**Our Solution:** Side-by-side test comparison and validation reporting to ensure migration accuracy and completeness.

## Differentiators

### Intelligent Pattern Recognition

Unlike manual conversion tools, we provide smart pattern recognition that understands Cypress command chains and converts them to idiomatic Playwright code. This results in cleaner, more maintainable test code.

### Complete Migration Pipeline

Unlike basic syntax converters, we offer end-to-end migration including configuration, custom commands, and project structure. This results in a fully functional Playwright setup ready for production use.

### Validation and Reporting

Unlike other migration tools, we provide comprehensive validation and comparison reports that verify migration accuracy. This results in confidence that converted tests maintain original functionality and coverage.

## Key Features

### Core Features

- **Automated Syntax Conversion:** Converts Cypress commands to Playwright equivalents with intelligent pattern matching
- **Configuration Migration:** Automatically migrates cypress.config.js settings to playwright.config.js format
- **Test Validation:** Compares original and converted tests to ensure behavioral consistency
- **Custom Command Conversion:** Transforms Cypress custom commands into Playwright page object methods

### Migration Features

- **Batch Processing:** Convert entire test suites in a single operation with progress tracking
- **Selective Conversion:** Choose specific test files or directories for targeted migration
- **Preview Mode:** Review proposed changes before applying conversions to source code
- **Rollback Capability:** Safely revert conversions if issues are discovered during validation

### Quality Assurance Features

- **Coverage Analysis:** Ensure converted tests maintain the same test coverage as original suites
- **Performance Comparison:** Benchmark test execution times between Cypress and Playwright versions
