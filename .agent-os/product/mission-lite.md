# Product Mission (Lite)

Cy-Playwright is a migration tool that helps development teams switch from Cypress to Playwright by providing automated test conversion, configuration migration, and validation capabilities.

Cy-Playwright serves development teams who need to migrate from Cypress to Playwright testing frameworks. Unlike manual conversion processes, Cy-Playwright provides intelligent automated syntax conversion, complete configuration migration, and comprehensive validation reporting to ensure migration accuracy and reduce transition time from weeks to days.
