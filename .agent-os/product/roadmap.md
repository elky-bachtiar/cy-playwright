# Product Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Migration Engine

**Goal:** Build the foundational syntax conversion system
**Success Criteria:** Successfully convert 80% of common Cypress patterns to Playwright

### Features

- [x] AST Parser for Cypress test files - Parse and analyze Cypress test syntax `M`
- [x] Basic command mapping engine - Convert cy.get(), cy.click(), cy.type() to Playwright equivalents `L`
- [x] Simple assertion conversion - Transform should() statements to expect() assertions `M`
- [x] File I/O system - Read Cypress files and write Playwright files `S`
- [x] CLI interface - Basic command-line tool for single file conversion `M`

### Dependencies

- TypeScript Compiler API setup
- Core file system operations
- Basic pattern matching algorithms

## Phase 2: Advanced Conversion & Configuration

**Goal:** Handle complex Cypress patterns and migrate project configuration
**Success Criteria:** Convert 95% of Cypress patterns and migrate complete project setup

### Features

- [x] Configuration migration - Convert cypress.config.js to playwright.config.js `L`
- [x] Custom command conversion - Transform Cypress.Commands.add() to Page Object methods `XL`
- [x] Intercept/Route conversion - Migrate cy.intercept() to page.route() patterns `L`
- [x] Fixture handling - Convert Cypress fixtures to Playwright test data `M`
- [x] Batch processing - Convert entire test suites in single operation `M`
- [ ] Preview mode - Show proposed changes before applying `M`

### Dependencies

- Phase 1 completion
- Configuration file parsers
- Template system for code generation

## Phase 3: Validation & Quality Assurance

**Goal:** Ensure converted tests maintain functionality and provide confidence
**Success Criteria:** Validate 100% of conversions with detailed reporting

### Features

- [ ] Test comparison engine - Side-by-side validation of original vs converted tests `XL`
- [ ] Coverage analysis - Ensure test coverage is maintained post-conversion `L`
- [ ] Performance benchmarking - Compare execution times between frameworks `M`
- [x] Migration report generation - Detailed conversion summary with statistics `M`
- [ ] Rollback functionality - Safely revert conversions if needed `L`

### Dependencies

- Phase 2 completion
- Test execution engines for both frameworks
- Reporting and analytics system
