- **Command Mapping and Conversion System**: Comprehensive conversion of Cypress syntax to Playwright
  - **Basic Commands**:
    - `cy.visit()` → `await page.goto()`
    - `cy.get()` → `page.locator()` or optimized semantic locators
    - `cy.click()` → `await locator.click()`
    - `cy.type()` → `await locator.fill()`
    - `cy.contains()` → `page.getByText()`
    - `cy.url()` → `page.url()`

  - **Selector Optimization**:
    - `[data-testid="x"]` → `page.getByTestId('x')`
    - `[role="button"]` → `page.getByRole('button')`
    - `[aria-label="Close"]` → `page.getByLabel('Close')`
    - `[placeholder="Search"]` → `page.getByPlaceholder('Search')`

  - **Assertion Conversion**:
    - `should('be.visible')` → `await expect(locator).toBeVisible()`
    - `should('contain.text', 'text')` → `await expect(locator).toContainText('text')`
    - `should('have.length', 5)` → `await expect(locator).toHaveCount(5)`
    - `should('have.value', 'value')` → `await expect(locator).toHaveValue('value')`

    - `cy.wait()` → `page.waitForTimeout()` or `page.waitForResponse()`
    - `cy.intercept()` → `page.route()` with handler conversion
